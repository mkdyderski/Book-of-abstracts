\emph{Mycobacterium bovis} infection, the cause of bovine tuberculosis
(BTB), costs an estimated \$3 billion to global agriculture annually.
During the last decade, the maturation of high-throughput sequencing
technologies coupled with well-annotated genome resources, has provided
an unprecedented opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of
host-pathogen interactions for many infectious diseases. Within this
context, transcriptional profiling of the host immune response to
\emph{M. bovis} infection is a powerful approach for identifying host
genes and cellular pathways important to disease pathology. For the
present study, ten age-matched male Holstein-Friesian calves were
infected endobronchially with \emph{M. bovis} (\textasciitilde{}2,000
CFU -- colony forming units). Peripheral blood samples were collected in
duplicate at four time points (-1 week pre-infection, +1 week, +2 week,
and +10 week post-infection) and used for:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  an overnight stimulation with purified protein derivative of bovine
  tuberculin (PPD-b) at 37\(^\circ\)C
\item
  a control overnight incubation at 37\(^\circ\)C without PPD-b
  stimulation.
\end{enumerate}

After isolation of total RNA, poly(A)+ purified RNA was used to generate
strand-specific RNA-seq libraries for high-throughput sequencing.
Transcripts were quality checked, adapter and quality filtered, and then
aligned to the \emph{Bos taurus} reference genome UMD3.1.1. Following
summarisation of gene counts, lowly expressed transcripts were removed
prior to subsequent gene annotation and differential expression
analyses. Results showed 929 differentially expressed (DE) genes at -1
week pre-infection, 1,619 DE genes +1 week post-infection, 1,170 DE
genes at +2 week, and 5,535 DE genes at +10 week (compared to
non-PPDb-stimulated group at each time point; FDR correction threshold
\(\leq\) 0.05).
