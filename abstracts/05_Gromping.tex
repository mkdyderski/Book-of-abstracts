This talk discusses the development of the landscape of packages on
Design of Experiments in \textbf{R}, the current state of which is
documented in the Experimental Design Task View
(\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ExperimentalDesign.html}).
That landscape is quite diverse, currently consisting of (at least) four
larger areas and various specialized packages. Descendants and relatives
of the pioneering packages \emph{conf.desig}n (2001) and
\emph{AlgDesign} (2004) as well as the growing area of packages for
computer experiments are considered in more detail, and recent additions
based on modern optimization methods are discussed.
