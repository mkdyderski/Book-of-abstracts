One of the key challenges to successfully harness the value of big data
is to uncover the critical insight through analytics and make it easily
accessible to decision markers in an intuitive way. \textbf{R}
\emph{shiny} offers a platform for developing an end-to-end solution
completely within \textbf{R} from mining the data with many modeling
choices to insight delivery via powerful and dynamic data visualization.
Such solution is highly suitable for agricultural data which is vast and
dynamic, and increasingly abundant due to the recent development and
adoption of precision farming and the related technologies. We would
like to illustrate a \emph{shiny} application that integrates a mixture
of privately collected and governmental data across many key dimensions
such as time, different geographic levels, crops and product types.
Analytics including both supervised and unsupervised modeling
capabilities and other approaches such as small area estimation, spatial
analysis and complex survey estimation are included. Among many other
specific examples is an application of discrete choice modeling using
hierarchical Bayesian estimation to capture the preference of brand or
product features and the price sensitivity by small geographic units and
also allow the users to conduct market simulation by changing product
mixture and prices. All the analytics are made and delivered in
real-time.
