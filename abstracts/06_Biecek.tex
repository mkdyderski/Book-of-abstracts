During the talk I will introduce The Programme for International Student
Assessment (PISA), an international survey that aims to evaluate
education systems worldwide. It's a source of large data about
educational performance and various other characteristics of over 2 000
000 students from 62 countries. The data from the last PISA assessment
is available in the \textbf{R} package.

To play with it we will use packages and to explain the relation between
parental occupation and student's performance. Then we will overview the
package -- the toolbox for statistical analyses of international
surveys. Finally we will discuss applications of packages and and the
role of reproducibility and traceability of results. At the end I will
introduce the project that aims to boost data science skills of
students.
