Changes in timing of phenological phases are important proxies in
contemporary climate research. The aim of the study was to create and
evaluate different statistical models for reconstructing and predicting
the selected phenological phase within \emph{caret} \textbf{R} package.
Three types of data sources were applied as predictors:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  satellite derived products,
\item
  preprocessed gridded meteorological data
\item
  spatial features (longitude, latitude, altitude) of the monitoring
  sites.
\end{enumerate}

The obtained results has shown potential for coupling meteorological
derived indices with remote sensing products in terms of phenological
(late spring) modelling. It was also shown that choosing a specific set
of predictors and applying a robust preprocessing procedures is more
affecting final results than applying a statistical model.
