\textbf{R} can be tamed for serious business usage and data analysis,
but this tool also has abilities for a different kind of approach:
creating data art. Even \textbf{R} might not be mainly marketed with its
graphics; it does have competence in genuine creativeness for unusual
visualizations. Thus, \textbf{R} is much more than just bar plots,
charts and maps -- it is only a matter of practice and adaptation.

Data art focuses using raw data to produce visualizations with both
aesthetic and informative scope. Having a creative process with digital
media, real-time data and \textbf{R}, may lead to producing alternative
interpretations from traditional information. Playing with \textbf{R}
graphics devices, one is able to adjust any kind of visual presentations
inside \textbf{R} console. Another option is to handle data manipulation
with \textbf{R} and print output with alternative graphic portals - such
as Processing or D3.

The presentation involves graphical visualizations, technical solutions,
and general ideas, how to use \textbf{R} in alternative ways. Telling a
story from data is a fun journey, therefore playing with \textbf{R} can
be rather an amusing \textbf{R}-experience. This program being my muse,
the aim is to inspire others.
