Most success stories of \textbf{R} in business are told by either new
economy companies or large international enterprises. However, there is
another field where \textbf{R} can enable success. Small to midsize,
mostly family owned, old economy companies: the Mittelstand. Besides its
size, Mittelstand companies are characterized by their organisational
culture, their value sets and their management philosophies. Hence, the
introduction of Data Science in general and \textbf{R} in particular to
Mittelstand companies needs to consider this specific characteristic in
order to be successful. This talk will focus on patterns that
Mittelstand companies typically follow when they implement \textbf{R}.
Main challenges of the process as well as road blockers on the way will
be pointed out. It will give practical advice with real world examples
and finally propose strategies of how to achieve long term success.
